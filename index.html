      <p class="our-approach-p">Over the last few years many organisations have sought “silver bullets” to change their organisation. They have used amongst other things; CBT, NLP, Mindfulness, Emotional intelligence etc., but we believe to drive transformational, rather than transactional change they need to address the individuals mind-set and work through the model above;<br><br>At Reframe we believe that everyone has the capacity to change their behaviour, and through that positive behaviour change, positive actions lead to strong performance.<br><br>Historically organisations have focused skills development around the actions that drive results, but we believe that by focusing on the individuals mind-set  and their  behaviour then positive change and reframing will happen.<br><br>We are passionate about people development, we are innovative in choosing tools and techniques and we look to ensure all our interventions are always memorable, meeting both the needs of the individual and the organisation.<br><br>We have a particular skill in training, coaching and mentoring experienced managers who have heard the theory but struggle to apply it in their work, and we have a deep empathy and understanding of the development needs of distance managers who work in geographic isolation.<br><br>Some of our recent clients are:</p>

            <p class="content-p">I possess a unique blend of leadership development experience coupled with senior commercial success, I am a certified NLP Master practitioner and coach, ITD qualified as a trainer, DiSC qualified and experienced in Consultancy.<br><br>I am passionate about people development and that passion is evident whether in one to one coaching, facilitating a group development session or presenting in front of hundreds of delegates at a conference. I am innovative in choosing tools and techniques and look to ensure my interventions are always memorable, meeting both the needs of the individual and the organisation. I have a particular skill in training, mentoring and coaching experienced managers who have heard the theory but struggle to apply it in their work, and I have a deep understanding of the development needs of distance managers who work in geographic isolation. Helping organisations and senior managers change culture and structure has been a feature of my work over the last five years both in facilitating senior management groups and helping individuals through coaching and mentoring where I also provide a career transition and personal coaching service to individuals.<br><br>Whilst people development has been the dominant characteristic of my career I have achieved commercial success in senior roles (Sales Director, Head of Sales) within Blue Chip organisations in Travel (Thomas Cook), and Financial Services (Santander, Lloyd’s Banking Group, Halifax), and worked in the not for profit/public sector as Operations Director for a public economic growth organisation (Opportunity Peterborough), and Citizens Advice Peterborough giving me the tact, gravitas and experience to facilitate and coach senior leaders.</p>

          <p>DiSC is a model of human behaviour that helps people understand “why they do what they do”, how to recognise behaviour in others (what makes them tick), and how behaviour can be adapted to get better responses from others.

          <p>DiSC is easy to understand, people get it quickly and can relate to it whatever their title, role or
            background.<br><br>DiSC provides a common language that we can use to discuss what behaviours we share with others
            and what we do differently.<br><br>DiSC is practical, after the Training workshop run by Kingsley you will be able to apply this knowledge
            immediately and see the difference.<br><br>The DiSC profile has been used over 50 million times, so you will be using a tool that is well
            researched and has worldwide credibility.<br><br></p>

              <p><span class="quote-mark">"</span>Having worked with Nick Owen over the last 3 months I have already started to see a dramatic improvement in my business. I have found Nick's understanding of estate agency refreshing and the strategies we have developed together has given my business renewed purpose and direction. On a more personal note having the opportunity to discuss business problems, concerns and successes has been of great benefit and a very positive experience.<span class="quote-mark">"</span><br><br><span class="estate-bold">- Garry Hone, Director of Advancing Property Ltd</span></p>

              <p><span class="quote-mark">"</span>The level of consultancy offerd by Nick Owen is simply exceptional. In only seven visits, he has already vastly improved the daily working performance of our Estate Agency and personally helped to give me more guidance and focus from a management level. His attention to detail is particularly impressive and every bit of advice is backed up by clear examples of how to put it in to practice. In my opinion, this is worth every penny and i would definitely recommend to anyone who is serious about developing their own business.<span class="quote-mark">"</span><br><br><span class="estate-bold">- Vito Fierro, Sales Director at City and County Estate Agency</span></p>

              <p><span class="quote-mark">"</span>Nick Owen has only been working with us for a relatively short period, however has made a huge impact in our business and feels like an integral part of our team. Nick's attitude to our business is that it's his business and really puts his heart and soul into every aspect, with attention to the smallest detail. I would be happy to recommend anyone to use his knowledge and expertise, but i would not want to lose him from our set up. He has become a mentor to me and a friend.<span class="quote-mark">"</span><br><br><span class="estate-bold">- Edward Gilbert, Managing Director at Moreland</span></p>
