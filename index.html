            <h1>Kingsley Taylor</h1>
            <p>I possess a unique blend of leadership development experience coupled with senior commercial success, I am a certified NLP Master practitioner and coach, ITD qualified as a trainer, DiSC qualified and experienced in Consultancy.<br><br>I am passionate about people development and that passion is evident whether in one to one coaching, facilitating a group development session or presenting in front of hundreds of delegates at a conference. I am innovative in choosing tools and techniques and look to ensure my interventions are always memorable, meeting both the needs of the individual and the organisation. I have a particular skill in training, mentoring and coaching experienced managers who have heard the theory but struggle to apply it in their work, and I have a deep understanding of the development needs of distance managers who work in geographic isolation. Helping organisations and senior managers change culture and structure has been a feature of my work over the last five years both in facilitating senior management groups and helping individuals through coaching and mentoring where I also provide a career transition and personal coaching service to individuals.<br><br>Whilst people development has been the dominant characteristic of my career I have achieved commercial success in senior roles (Sales Director, Head of Sales) within Blue Chip organisations in Travel (Thomas Cook), and Financial Services (Santander, Lloyd’s Banking Group, Halifax), and worked in the not for profit/public sector as Operations Director for a public economic growth organisation (Opportunity Peterborough), and Citizens Advice Peterborough giving me the tact, gravitas and experience to facilitate and coach senior leaders.</p>

            and what we do differently.<br><br>DiSC is practical, after the Training workshop run by Kingsley you will be able to apply this knowledge
            immediately and see the difference.<br><br>The DiSC profile has been used over 50 million times, so you will be using a tool that is well
